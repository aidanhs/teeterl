teeterl is a lean portable Erlang.

teeterl is built using Apache Portable Runtime, a library tested on dozens
of OSes and their flavours.

teeterl borrows from industry-standard Erlang/OTP, especially when it comes
to compiler front-end.

This is an new major version of teeterl. Quite immature. The previous version
lives in vintage folder. Consult README file found there.

The current version is only able to run a couple of test suites but the
results of preliminary performance testing indicate that the current version
is 3-4 times swifter than the previous one.

The current version is being developed under Windows XP. Under Windows XP
using Visual Studio 5.0+ teeterl can be built from the provided project
file. Expect to resolve a few dependencies manually. After clean built, just
hit F5 and point your browser to http://localhost:9090 and rudimentary
teeterl interface should show up. At that point it would be obvious that
there is much to be done for the new teeterl.

If you want to feel more in control about VM internals and think that
Erlang/OTP is too much for you then you are welcome to use and extend
teeterl.
